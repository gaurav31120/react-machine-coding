NEXT PROBLEM #2 (VERY IMPORTANT)
❓ Problem: “Select All / Unselect All Checkboxes”

This is a classic React interview + real project problem.

📋 Problem Statement

You have a list:

[ ] Select All
[ ] React
[ ] Angular
[ ] Vue

Rules

1️⃣ Clicking Select All

selects all items

2️⃣ Unchecking Select All

clears all items

3️⃣ If all items are manually selected

“Select All” should auto-check

4️⃣ If any one item is unchecked

“Select All” should auto-uncheck

🧠 Why this problem matters

This teaches:

derived state

array length logic

controlled inputs (we’ll revisit this later 😉)

real-world UX logic

This is FAANG-level checkbox logic.
