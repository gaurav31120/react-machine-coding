🟡 MEDIUM #1: Todo App (Add & Delete)

This is the most common medium machine-coding question.

📌 Problem Statement (Interview-style)
Todo App – Add & Delete

Create a React application that allows users to add and delete todo items.

✅ Requirements

Display an input field to type a todo.

Display an Add button.

When the user clicks Add:

The todo should be added to a list.

Input should be cleared.

Display the list of todos.

Each todo should have a Delete button.

Clicking Delete should remove that todo from the list.

🧠 What this problem tests (VERY IMPORTANT)

Array state management

Rendering lists with map

Handling events inside lists

Immutable state updates

If you solve this cleanly → you’re officially in interview-ready territory.
